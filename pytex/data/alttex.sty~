%                             PiTutor workflow
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% piTutor performs many operations under-the-hood before generating the 
% individualized documents from LaTeX files. Even though the input TeX files are 
% valid tex, they do not generate the desired output if run directely through 
% the LaTeX processor.
%
% The workflow consists into the following steps
%
%   1) Move the necessary files to working directory
%   2) \alt expansion. Creates many LaTeX files for each section
%   4) Special commands substitutions (for \multiplechoice, \truefalse, etc)
%   5) Consolidate multiple files
%   6) Tex execution
%   7) Insertion of python code
%   8) Re-execute TeX until no changes occur
%   9) Move back outputs to callee's folder
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%                    Step 1: Move files to working directory
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% In order to preserve a clean building environment, the default behavior is to 
% create symlinks of all files and directories in the current working dir to 
% a subdirectory called ".tmp-piTutor". The contents of this directory are 
% used to accelerate the building process and can be safely removed.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%                       Step 2: Alternatives handling
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The alttex preprocessor enables the creation of multiple versions of a 
% document from a single source. The processor runs the document a certain
% number of times and then join the results into one or more final documents. 
% The original goal is to make different versions of an exam from a single 
% LaTeX source. Other people may find other uses for this package.
%
% There are two kinds of variations, which we call `sections` and `versions`. 
% Different sections create output for different final documents. Within the 
% same section, all versions are merged together in the final phase of 
% preparation.
%
% Consider the example:
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%     How much is $\alt{1 + 1|2 + 1|1 + 2}$?
%     
%     \altcond{answer}
%        {Re: $\alt{1 + 1 = 2|2 + 1 = 3|1 + 2 = 3}$}
%        {Tip: the answer is a whole number!}
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% This simple source creates 6 documents aggregated into two files. The first 
% file corresponds to the "answer" section, and aggregates the 3 alternative
% versions asking the result of 1 + 1, 2 + 1 or 1 + 2 respectively. 
%
% The second file is the output of the implied "default" section. This file will
% show the text "Tip: ...", as defined by the third argument of the 
% \ifsection command.
%
% The basic commands are
%
% Inline commands:
%     \alt{a|b|c|...}
%           Cycle between the options a, b, c, ... at each version of the 
%           document.
%
%     \alt[sec1, sec2]{a|b|c...}
%           Same as above, but only outputs in the sections specified in the 
%           argument.
%
%     \alt[!sec1, !sec2]{a|b|c...}
%           Outputs on all sections but "sec1" and "sec2"
%
%     \altcond{sec1, sec2}{a|b|c...}{z|w|x...}
%           If section is sec1 or sec2, cycles between a, b, c, etc, otherwise 
%           cycles between z, w, x, etc. The ! syntax of the \alt command is
%           also allowed.
%
%     \aline{sec1, sec2, ...}
%           Inserts a new \\ if in one of the specified sections.
%
%     \apar{sec1, sec2, ...}
%           Inserts a new \par if in one of the specified sections.

\newcommand{\alt}[2][empty]{~||alt:\ {#2}||~}
\newcommand{\altcond}[3]{if({#1})~show~({#2})~else~({#3})~}
\newcommand{\aline}[1]{\\}
\newcommand{\apar}[1]{\par}

%.
% Command constants:
%     \secname
%           Expand to the current section name
%
%     \altidx{0 or 1} 
%           The index for the current version, starting from 0 or 1 (default).
%           The optional argument can also be "letter", "l", "LETTER", "L", 
%           "roman", "r", or "R" in order to express the index as a letter 
%           (in lower or UPPER case) or as a roman numeral.
%           
%           The LaTeX parser identifies \altindex0 and \altindex{0} as the same
%           thing. The former version may look more readable, but \altindex10 
%           may not work as expected...
%
%     \maxversions
%           Expand to the number of versions in the current job.
%
%     \setversions{value}
%           Define the default number of alternative versions that should be 
%           created by alttex.

% Variables and namespace
% -----------------------
%
% The alttex engine has an interface with Python in order to programatically
% generate input to be inserted at the LaTeX documents. The most basic command
% is the \var{name@filters}, which inserts the contents of the given variable
% into the final TeX document. The user can define many sources of data for 
% feeding values to these variables: by commands in the LaTeX file, python 
% programs, external files, etc.
%
% For starters, one can define variables inside the TeX document using the 
% "variables" environment,
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%     \begin{variables}
%       \def fooA = 2
%       \def fooB = 3
%       \def fooC = \alt{1|2|3} % a variable with alternatives
%     \end{variables}
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% This will create the variables fooA, and fooB, assigned to the respective 
% value in the RHS.
%
% Newlines and trailing spaces will be simply ignored. Comments are also 
% ignored, so "\item num = 42 % the answer!" will be expanded
% to "42" when \var{num} is called and not to "42 % the answer!", or something
% similar.
%
% Variables can be created programatically by executing programs in other languages 
% rather than LaTeX. This is done by the "namespace" block, which takes an obligatory
% argument telling the programming language (or its specific variant) in which 
% the code is written.
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%     \begin{namespace}{python}
%       from random import shuffle
%       L = [1,2,3]
%       shuffle(L)
%       ns.a, ns.b, ns.c = L
%     \end{namespace}
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% The way the variables are imported depends on the programming language. For 
% python, the code is executed with a "namespace" (and its alias "ns") variable
% already set up in the globlals() dictionary. All elements assigned as 
% attributes to this variable will be available to the \var command.
%
% Finally, there is the \importscript{language}{file} command. It will run an
% external file and import its variables similarly as if the source code were 
% typed into the "namespace" block.

%  Mathematical expressions
%
%  The alttex engine has support to symbolic manipulation of mathematical 
%  expressions

% Environments:
%     \begin{alternatives}[section]
%       \item a
%       \item b
%       \else c
%     \end{alternatives}
%
% The document is thus processed and a different .tex file for each section/version 
% is created
%
% Here we define dummies that just print interrogation marks in the position of
% the alternatives.

% Aliases for Jinja2 markup. These are defined as empty verb-like commands and
% just output interrogation marks in the PDF output. However, they can be 
% translated by the Jinja templating engine and used to generate a templete for
% creating LaTeX files.
% 
% Jinja templates are mostly used when one wants to separate Python code from 
% LaTeX presentation. Jinja template expressions may also be used in order to
% automate the creation of certain documents with repetitive structures.
%
% Think of Jinja as a kind of pre-processor.
%
% Variable blocks: A variable input block can be defined as \VAR{foo|bar}. 
% This prints the value of the variable "foo" processed with the "bar" filter.  
%\newcommand{\VAR}[1]{\texttt{#1}}

% Command blocks: Can run loops, conditionals and other commands. The example
% bellow shows a simple loop that print the first 10 numbers
%
%               \CMD{for i in range(10)}\VAR{i + 1}, \CMD{endfor}
%\newcommand{\CMD}[1]{??}

% Comment blocks: Can put anything that shall not be passed to the LaTeX 
% processor

%   Hello \VAR{i}
%   %- endfor
%   %! This is a template comment line, and shall not appear in the final
%   %! rendered document
%
% No special command needs to be defined since it is interpreted by LaTeX
% as a comment.

% Data block: Optionally, Jinja variables may be initialized by some source of
% data source. It can be, for example, a Python script or a JSON data structure.
% A file with the same name (but the appropriate extension) of the TeX source
% suffices to define a data source. One can override this behavior using the
